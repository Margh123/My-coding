	search for a music company </p>

	<source src="GapNhungKhongOLai.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> <br>
	<p> This is my arrangement of the song "Gap Nhung Khong O Lai". In general, I have seen a lot of staves in Musescore company 
	and they encourage opening <br> an online class for teaching music while aiding users about the problems in the Musescore program.
	In order to be sucessfully recruited, I should be active <br> not only my Programming skills but also my music skills.</p>

	me to make the corelate sheet music for you. This will be available on my <a href="Blog.html">Blog</a></p>

	would be error-prone for this project but It is still my<br> determination to help the community that I want to complete the coding, the design aside
	soon as possible. <br><b>Here is the prototypes of XML plugin:</b></p><br>
